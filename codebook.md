Note - Variable naming

I updated the feature variable names in the tidy data (vs. the names in the source data described in features_info.txt) to make it easier for consumers of the data to understand the measurement of each column. The names use the following conventions:

The first word(s) indicates the type of metric, Mean or StandardDeviation
Next, FFT is included, if applicable, to indicate that the measurement had a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied.
Either Body or Gravity is included to indicate the type of signal
Either Acceleration or AngularVelocity is included to indicate the type of measurement. I replaced "Gyro" with "AngularVelocity" since that's what the gyroscope is measuring.
Jerk indicates a measure where the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
Magnitude indicates a magnitude calculation
XAxis, YAxis, and ZAxis indicate a measurement for the X, Y, or Z axis.
Here are some example mappings of old to new column names:

Old: tBodyAcc-mean()-X
New: MeanBodyAccelerationXAxis

Old: tGravityAcc-std()-Y

New: StandarddeviationGravityAccelerationYAxis

Old: fBodyGyroMag-std()

New: StandardDeviationFFTBodyAngularVelocityMagnitude
